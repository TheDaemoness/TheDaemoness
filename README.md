# TheDaemoness
__Critique Mailer Daemon v5.5 â“’ 19xx__

I'm a recovering perfectionist who makes stuff for tinkerers/hackers.
Currently I'm mainly contributing improvements to newer parts of the IRC ecosystem.

## Tools of Choice

* Languages: Rust, Haskell, Scala
* OS: Linux (Arch, btw)
* Terminal: [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
* Text Editor: [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org/)
* IRC Client: [glirc](https://github.com/glguy/irc-core)
* Dotfiles: No they're mine you can't have them.

## Me In Other Places

I'm on [sr.ht](https://git.sr.ht/~daemoness/).
Many of my projects will be found there instead of Github.

I'm on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) as `She`.
Be aware that I often block PMs from unregistered users.

## My Emails

My public email address, base64'd to deter low-effort web scraping,
is `c2hlQGRhZW1vbmVzcy5kZXYK`.
If you use the word `albatross` in the subject,
I'll be more likely to assume you're a real human.
