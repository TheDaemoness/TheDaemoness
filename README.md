I'm a software craftswoman for whom F/OSS has been a lifelong passion.
I have been daily driving Linux for years,
and have been developing software when I see a need for it.
I also give scathing but (hopefully) constructive code reviews.
I enjoy teaching what I know, and I'd like to think I know some stuff.

## Tools of Choice

* Languages: Rust, Haskell, Scala
* OS: Linux (Arch, btw)
* Terminal: [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
* Text Editor: [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org/) ([for now](https://helix-editor.com/))
* Dotfiles: No they're mine you can't have them.

## Getting In Touch

Send me an email. If you use the word `albatross` in the subject,
I'll be more likely to assume you're a real human.

If soft realtime communication is more your thing, I'm on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/).
I'm on there at all times of day, almost always using the nickname `She`.
You will need to be registered and authenticated with NickServ.

I usually don't bite.
