__Critique Mailer Daemon v5.3 â“’ 19xx__

I'm a software craftswoman for whom F/OSS has been a lifelong passion.
I have been daily driving Linux for years,
and have been developing software when I see a need for it.
I also give scathing but (hopefully) constructive code reviews.
I enjoy teaching what I know, and I'd like to think I know some stuff.

## Tools of Choice

* Languages: Rust, Haskell, Scala
* OS: Linux (Arch, btw)
* Terminal: [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
* Text Editor: [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org/) ([for now](https://helix-editor.com/))
* Dotfiles: No they're mine you can't have them.

## Me In Other Places

I'm on [sr.ht](https://git.sr.ht/~daemoness/).
Many of my projects will be found there instead of Github.

I'm on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) at almost all times of day,
almost always using the nickname `She`.
If you want to chat with me there in private,
you will need to be [registered and authenticated](https://libera.chat/guides/registration)
and be in `#linux` (or any other channel that I'm in).

## My Email

My public email address, base64'd to deter web scraping, is `c2hlQGRhZW1vbmVzcy5kZXYK`.
I use that address in my more recent commits.
If you use the word `albatross` in the subject,
I'll be more likely to assume you're a real human.
