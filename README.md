__Critique Mailer Daemon v5.6 ⓒ 19xx__

I'm a recovering perfectionist who makes stuff for tinkerers/hackers.
Currently I'm mainly contributing improvements to newer parts of the IRC ecosystem.

## Tools of Choice

* Languages: Rust, Haskell, Scala
* OS: Gentoo Linux
* Terminal: [wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm?tab=readme-ov-file#wezs-terminal)
* Text Editor: [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org/)
* IRC Client: [glirc](https://github.com/glguy/irc-core)
* Dotfiles: No they're mine you can't have them.

## Me In Other Places

I'm on [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/daemoness).

I'm on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) as `She`.
Be advised that I often ignore PMs from strangers that aren't obviously support requests.

## My Emails

My public email address, base64'd to deter low-effort web scraping,
is `c2hlQGRhZW1vbmVzcy5kZXYK`.
If you use the word `albatross` in the subject,
I'll be more likely to assume you're a real human.
