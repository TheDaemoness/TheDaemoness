I'm a software craftswoman for whom FOSS has been a lifelong passion.
I agive scathing but (hopefully) constructive code reviews.
I enjoy teaching what I know, and have experience in many fields.

## Getting In Touch

At the moment, the best way to contact me as a stranger is to PM me on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/).
I'm on there at all times of day, almost always using the nickname `She`.
You will need to be registered and authenticated with NickServ.
I usually don't bite.
