I'm a software craftswoman for whom F/OSS has been a lifelong passion.
I have been daily driving Linux for years,
and have been developing software when I see a need for it.
I also give scathing but (hopefully) constructive code reviews.
I enjoy teaching what I know, and I'd like to think I know some stuff.

## Tools of Choice

* Languages: Rust, Haskell, Scala
* OS: Linux (Arch, btw)
* Editor: [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org/) ([for now](https://helix-editor.com/))

## Getting In Touch

At the moment, the best way to contact me as a stranger is to PM me on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/).
I'm on there at all times of day, almost always using the nickname `She`.
You will need to be registered and authenticated with NickServ.
I usually don't bite.
